# Data Structures and Algorithms – Java

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** form the foundation of problem-solving and coding interviews.  
This repository provides a structured, comprehensive set of DSA problems implemented in **Java**, designed for **students, job aspirants, and software engineers**.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository is designed to complement a **DSA Practice Workbook** (Google Doc), which contains:

- Detailed **concept explanations**  
- Step-by-step **logic and approach**  
- **Dry run examples** for better understanding  

Students and learners are encouraged to:

1. Study the concepts in the workbook.  
2. Practice the corresponding Java programs here.  
3. Modify and experiment with code to strengthen understanding.

## ▶ How to Run the Java Programs

You can run the programs in **GitHub Codespaces** or locally:

1. Navigate to the desired folder:

```bash
cd 02_Arrays
````

2. Compile the Java file:

```bash
javac ReverseArray.java
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
java ReverseArray
```

> **Tip:** Each Java file is self-contained and follows **best practices**, with comments explaining the logic.
